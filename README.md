## Abstract
The ability to create high-quality 3D faces from a single image has become in-
creasingly important with wide applications in video conferencing, AR/VR, and
advanced video editing in movie industries. In this paper, we propose Face Diffu-
sion NeRF(FDNeRF), a new generative method to reconstruct high-quality Face
NeRFs from single images, complete with semantic editing and relighting capabili-
ties. FDNeRF utilizes high-resolution 3D GAN inversion and expertly trained 2D
latent-diffusion model, allowing users to manipulate and construct Face NeRFs in
zero-shot learning without the need for explicit 3D data. With carefully designed
illumination and identity preserving loss, as well as multi-modal pre-training, FD-
NeRF offers users unparalleled control over the editing process enabling them
to create and edit face NeRFs using just single-view images, text prompts, and
explicit target lighting. The advanced features of FDNeRF have been designed to
produce more impressive results than existing 2D editing approaches that rely on
2D segmentation maps for editable attributes. Experiments show that our FDNeRF
achieves exceptionally realistic results and unprecedented flexibility in editing
compared with state-of-the-art 3D face reconstruction and editing methods
